This a first draft if Inter-Kernel Communication for POE.  It is intended
as a point of reference for discusion of issues involved.  

As "Mythical Man Month" says : Plan to throw one away.


You will need the latest version of POE.  IKC has a sneaky way of
discovering bugs and lacunae in POE :)


Quick test :
perl Makefile.PL
make
./server & ./client
... and wait 

Better yet, run ./server and ./client in seperate windows.  ./client should
output a . every 10 seconds.  Running many clients will give you an idea of
the overhead :)

STABILITY 

I used to use IKC full time on my sites.  However, I've moved to exclusively 
developing Intranet applications.  One of my main apps (http://www.quaero.ca/) 
has a POEx::HTTP::Server front end and talks IKC with an application server.
This means IKC handles thousands of requests an hour.  I trust it, but then I
know what I'm doing.
